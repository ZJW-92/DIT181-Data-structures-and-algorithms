## Course content
The course introduces the students to the role of data structures and algorithmic concepts in the detailed design and implementation of programs. The course has twogeneral themes: 
- (1) the role of algorithms in the design and development of programs;
- (2) the role of data structures in the implementation of algorithms.

These general themes are supported by the study of sub themes from the field of computer science:
 - Asymptotic efficiency and complexity notations.
 - Algorithm design techniques such as brute force, anddivide and conquer.
 - Algorithms recurrent in engineering research literature such as searching andsorting.
 - Common data structures and abstract data types, such as arrays, stacks and queues, linked lists, treesandhash tables.
 - Recursion.
